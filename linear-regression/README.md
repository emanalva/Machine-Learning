  ### Model from Scratch
  ##### Simple one independent variable, one dependent variable
  #### Code:
  - [linear-regression.py](./linear-regression.py)
  
  - [test-linear-regression.py](./test-linear-regression.py)
  ##### Multiple independent variables with one dependent variable
  #### Code:
  - [linear-regression-multiple-features.py](./linear-regression-multiple-features.py)
  
  - [test-linear-regression-multiple-features.py](./test-linear-regression-multiple-features.py)

  ### Model using Libraries
  ##### Multiple independent variables with one dependent variable
  #### Code:
  - [linear-regression-lib.py](./linear-regression-lib.py)
  
  - [test-linear-regression-lib.py](./test-linear-regression-lib.py)

  #### Dataset(s):
  - [carDetails.csv](./carDetails.csv) # Has objects in column of Max Power
  
  - [cleaned_carDetails.csv](./cleaned_carDetails.csv) # Has floats in column of Max Power
