### Directories

#### [linear-regression](./linear-regression/README.md)
Scripts incorporating linear regression models: 
 - One built from scratch using gradient descent and another using libraries.
 - Includes scripts with one independent variable and scripts with multiple.
 - The try-3-features branch uses 3 features, while the main branch uses 5 features (features = independent variables).

### [logistic-regression](./logistic-regression/README.md): 
 - Scripts using logistic regression to classify data, similar to the linear regression models but for categorical outcomes.
